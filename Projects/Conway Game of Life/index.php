    <p class="font-weight-bold">Rules of the game:</p>
    <p>The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. For every cycle of the game,
    the cells can be turned on or off based on the following rules:
    <br>
1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population. <br>
2.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding. <br>
3.  Any live cell with two or three live neighborsâ€™ lives on to the next generation. <br>
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.<br>

6. If a live cell has less than two live neighbors, it dies<br>
7. If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies<br>
8. If a live cell has two or three live neighbors,

these simple rules create interesting, often unpredictable patterns.<br>
